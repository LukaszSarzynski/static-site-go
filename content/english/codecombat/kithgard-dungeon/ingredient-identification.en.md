Solution

```javascript
// A variable is a container with a label that holds data.

// This variable is named `someVariableName`
// It contains the value `"a string"`
var someVariableName = "a string";

// This variable is named `lolol`
// It contains the number `42`
var lolol = 42;

// Create 2 more variables and assign values to them:
// You can name them whatever you want, and hold any value in them!
// Use `=` to assign a value to a variable.
var oBlueBootle = "lolol";
var oRedBootle = "someVariableName";

```
